## REQUIRED PRE-REQUESITES

### Windows 7/8.1/10 pre-requesites

1. Install PowerShell 6: [Download Installer for version 6.1.3](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.1.3/PowerShell-6.1.3-win-x64.msi)
2. Install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5.1 or later: [Web Installer](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/dotnet-framework-runtime)
3. Update GPU drivers: [Nvidia 419.35](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) and [AMD Adrenalin 2019 Edition 19.3.1](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download/desktop?os=Windows+10+-+64)
4. RainbowMiner's overclocking features rely on MSI Afterburner, you should install and run it: [Download](http://download.msi.com/uti_exe//vga/MSIAfterburnerSetup.zip)
5. If you plan on using [GrinProMiner](https://grinpro.io) or [SwapMiner](https://github.com/swap-dev/SwapReferenceMiner/releases): Install Microsoft [.NET Core 2.2 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) - download and install "Run Apps .NET Core Runtime", click the button "** Download .NET Core Runtime (see here: https://github.com/RainbowMiner/RainbowMiner/issues/441#issuecomment-465932125) **"

Finally: check, if Powershell 6 is in your PATH, because RainbowMiner will not run correctly, if the path to powershell is missing. Sometimes "C:\Program Files\PowerShell\6" has to be added manually to the PATH environement variable after installing Powershell 6.1.0. Here is a nice tutorial, how to add to PATH environment variable https://www.howtogeek.com/118594/how-to-edit-your-system-path-for-easy-command-line-access/amp/

### Linux pre-requesites

1. Open cmd window and install 7zip and git

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install p7zip-full
sudo apt-get install git
```

2. Install Powershell Core

Find the matching version of [Powershell Core v6.2.0 for your Linux distro from here](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases) and download it to your machine.
Now, either use the GUI installer to install the package or do it manually, e.g. for Ubuntu:
```
# if not already done, download the package, change the ubuntu distro version number!
wget https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/releases/download/v6.2.0/powershell_6.2.0-1.ubuntu.18.04_amd64.deb

# install powershell package
dpkg -i powershell_6.2.0-1.ubuntu.18.04_amd64.deb

# install powershell dependecies
apt install -f
```

3. Make sure, you have installed the most uptodate GPU drivers *plus* CUDA and OpenCL. If RainbowMiner does not show your graphic cards, double check that the OpenCL libraries are installed correctly. Sometimes you will need to install opencl (the ocl-icd-libopencl1 package) manually:
```
sudo apt install ocl-icd-libopencl1
```

## INSTALLATION

### Windows Installation Steps 1 - 3

1. Download and extract to your desktop: [![current release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/RainbowMiner/RainbowMiner.svg)](https://github.com/RainbowMiner/RainbowMiner/releases)

2. Add the directory of RainbowMiner to the exceptions of your antivirus program. Some miner cause false virus alerts.

3. Right-click "Start.bat", choose "Run as administrator".

</details>

### Linux Installation Steps 1 - 3

1. Download Rainbowminer, you may use git to make it quick and easy:
```
git clone https://github.com/rainbowminer/RainbowMiner
```

2. Finally, change the attributes of start.sh
```
cd Rainbowminer
chmod 755 start.sh
```

3. Start it
```
./start.sh
```

### Common steps

4. Enter your credentials:
   - your btc-wallet address (one for general use, and one for NiceHash)
   - your desired workername (or accept the default)
   - your MiningPoolHub username, if you plan to use this pool
   - your region. Valid names are: US, Europe, Asia
   - your currencies. Valid currencies are: BTC, USD, EUR, GBP, ETH, ..
   - the pools, you want to mine as comma separated list. 
   - the algorithm, you want to mine as comma separated list.
   - the devices, you want to use for mining. Valid descriptors are: gpu, cpu, nvidia, amd (RainbowMiner will show you, which devices are available on your machine)
     or use your device names (without spaces, without leading geforce): gtx1070, gtx1080ti ..
     
5. Let the downloads and benchmarking finish (be patient! This might take a while. Anyway: it will already mine to your wallets)

Done!

## HOTKEYS

You can press the follwing keys, while RainbowMiner is waiting for the next run.

- E[**x**]it Miningscript = stop all running miner and exit RainbowMiner
- [**S**]kip switching prevention = immediately start the most profitable miner, without waiting for the switching prevention
- start [**D**]ownloader = start the downloader manually (only needed, if you manually updated a miner)
- [**C**]onfiguration = goto the configuration setup (after setup all miner will be restarted)
- [**V**]erbose off/on = switch the user interface from lite(=off) to full(=on)
- [**P**]ause = stop all running miner and wait until user presses P again
- [**U**]pdate = if a new release of RainbowMiner is available, this option will show up. Pressing this key will start the automatic update.


## RECOMMENDATIONS & HELPERS

- Set your Windows virtual memory size to a fixed size of at least 16GB, or better to the sum of your GPU memories x 1.5, e.g. if you have 6x GTX1070 8GB installed, use at least 72GB (Computer Properties->Advanced System Settings->Performance->Advanced->Virtual Memory)
- Submit bugs and feature requests here: https://github.com/RainbowMiner/RainbowMiner/issues 
- if mining on GeForce GTX 1070/GTX 1070Ti/GTX 1080/GTX 1080Ti, it is recommended to disable "Force P2 State", so that the card will always operate in P0 state. [How to set P0 state for my GTX1070 and GTX1080](https://github.com/RainbowMiner/RainbowMiner/issues/36)
- Important: **NEVER EDIT THE "Start.bat" !** It will break the autoupate. If you want to add tools to the batch, make a copy of the Start.bat and edit and use this to start RainbowMiner.
- the root directory of RainbowMiner contains the following, additional batch files:
  - **ListDevices.bat**: if clicked, a window will popup and list all available devices
  - **MinerLog.bat**: it reopens the window to show the output of the miners. Useful, if you unintentionally closed this log window.
  - **RemoveLogs.bat**: delete all log files to save some disk space
  - **RemovePresets.bat**: block presets from being written to miners.config.txt (see section MINERS)
  - **ResetBenchmark.bat**: reset all benchmarks
  - **ResetBenchmarkAMD.bat**: reset all AMD benchmarks
  - **ResetBenchmarkCPU.bat**: reset all CPU benchmarks
  - **ResetBenchmarkNVIDIA.bat**: reset all NVIDIA benchmarks
  - **ResetProfit.bat**: reset RainbowMiner's profit calculation
  - **Stopp.bat**: halt RainbowMiner at once
  - **Updater.bat**: update to newest release of RainbowMiner manually. Make sure, you stop RainbowMiner before running this helper
  	

## WEB-INTERFACE

For your convenience, you can monitor and setup RainbowMiner using your web browser. The web interface very prominently shows RainbowMiner's live profitability and the current BTC exchange rates. To start the web interface, simply open the URL [localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in a new browser tab.
- Dashboard: shows the live running miners & pool balances, click the Pause/Restart button to halt and restart RainbowMiner. It will take up to 20 seconds, until the miner script finalize the pause/restart procedure, so give it some time.
- Selected Devices: lists the preselected devices
- All Devices: lists all available devices in your rig
- Best Pools: lists the best possible pool for every algorithm
- All Pools: lists all pools available vs. all algorithm
- Miners: lists all miners vs. all algorithm

<details><summary>Notes for NiceHash</summary>

If you plan to mine through Nicehash, I strongly recommend, that you register an account with them (https://www.nicehash.com/register). In this case, Nicehash will provide you with an extra NiceHash wallet/bitcoin address (RainbowMiner will ask for this address during the setup or configuration process).
This lowers the minimum payout sum from 0.1BTC (for external wallet) to a very low 0.001BTC (for Nicehash wallet). An additional benefit for Coinbase users: sending BTC from the Nicehash wallet to your Coinbase account is free of charge.</details>
<details><summary>Notes for the pools BlockCruncher, BlockMasters, Bsod, CryptoKnight, GosCx, HashRefinery, Icemining, MinerRocks, NLpool, PhiPhiPool, PocketWhale, Ravenminer, YiiMP and Zpool</summary>
  
The miner can be setup to mine any coin or currency, that is listed at the respective pool. The pool will then payout to the given non-BTC wallet address. Take into account, that non-BTC payouts depend heavily on that coin being mined. If the pool has not or is not mining that currency, the payouts will be delayed until the pool has mined the blocks. Read the pools websites, about the mineability and reliability of a currency. It's recommended to use BTC as any other coin could be removed at anytime and payouts will not occur. The pools Bsod, CryptoKnight, GosCx, Icemining, MinerRocks, PhiPhiPool, PocketWhale, Ravenminer and Yiimp do not have auto-exchange to BTC. Please be careful, what you choose to mine.
</details>
<details><summary>Notes for Solo- and Party-mining</summary>
  
Bsod.pw, Gos.cx and ZergPool allow solo mining and party mining. This is achieved by adding parameters "m=solo" or "m=party.yourpassword" to the password of the pool. There are two ways to achieve this with RainbowMiner:
- either supply `"BTC-Params": "m=solo",` / `"BTC-Params": "m=party.password",` in pools.config.txt and use the standard pools modules "Bsod", "GosCx", "Zergpool", "ZergpoolCoins"
- or use the special pool modules "BsodSolo", "BsodParty", "GosCxSolo", "GosCxParty", "ZergpoolSolo", "ZergpoolParty", "ZergpoolCoinsSolo", "ZergpoolCoinsParty" - in case of party mining, these pool modules come with an extra parameter "PartyPassword" in pools.config.txt
</details>


## MINERS

- The RainbowMiner contains a list of well approved miners in the directory "Miners"
- The miner Excavator mines on NiceHash pool, only
- Miners Excavator & Excavator1.4.4 run in their own miner window, even if you select to hide miner windows.
- Each miner's algorithm can be fine tuned for each device in your mining rig

### Special finetuning

The following miners can be fine tuned, using config files. Most of the config files are being generated upon the first start of the miner. All config files will be written once, only, and kept through miner updates. To let Rainbowminer recreate those files, they will have to be deleted.

|Minername|Type|Path|Configfile(s)|Documentation Link|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|FireIce/XMR-Stak|AMD|Bin\Cryptonight-FireIce|amd.txt|https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/tuning.md|

## ALGORITHMS

RainbowMiner uses a build-in hash table to convert different algorithmnames to unique and beautified, internal representations. Because of this, you do not have to care too much about how to write an algorithm, when directly editing the "Config\config.txt" or using command line parameters. E.g. cryptonight-v7, cryptonight/1, cryptonightv7 would all be converted to CryptonightV7.

## Special notes for Equihash

The different Equihash algorithms are distinguished using the following Parameters: (n, k). For example, the classic Equihash first used by Zcash used n = 200 and k = 9, so it became Equihash (200, 9).

The n and k values create enormous differences in the minimum memory requirement, and create enormous differences in how the actual mining software is coded in order to do the mining.

RainbowMiner uses the following nameing convention:
- Equihash16x5 = Equihash (96, 5)
- Equihash20x9 = Equihash (200, 9)
- Equihash21x9 = Equihash (210, 9)
- Equihash24x5 = Equihash (144,5), e.g. BTG
- Equihash25x5 = Equihash (150,5), e.g. BEAM
- Equihash24x7 = Equihash (192,7), e.g. ZEROcoin

The new numbers (16x5, 20x9, ..) describe the number of bits matched in each round for the algorithm, and provide a relative measure of the “hardness” of the algorithm (the numbers can be calculated, using n and k: n/(k+1) )

RainbowMiner's build-in hash table makes it possible for you, to use many different algorithmnames. E.g. equihash-144_5, equihash1445, equihash-btg, equihash144btg will all be represented by Equihash24x5. beam will be represented by Equihash25x5


## OVERCLOCKING OVERVIEW

There are two ways to adjust overclocking values in RainbowMiner:
- **Option1: MSI Afterburner profiles**
  - recommended for **mining rigs with max. 6 identical GPUs**
  - to enable, set "**MSIAprofile**" to the number of your default AB profile ([C]onfiguration->[C]ommon)
  - MSI Afterburner profiles are addressed by number 1-5
- **Option2: custom overclocking profiles**
  - recommended for mining rigs with **more than 6 or mixed GPUs**
  - to enable, set "**EnableOCProfiles**" to "**1**" ([C]onfiguration->[C]ommon)
  - custom profiles have freely defined names (it differs from option 1!)
  - **important:** set a default profile for each GPU group ([C]onfiguration->[D]evices). Use the name of the profiles (look into ocprofiles.config.txt, if in doubt)
  - independant of MSI Afterburner

If you do not want to use the overclocking features in RainbowMiner: set both, "**EnableOCProfiles**" and "**MSIAprofile**", to "**0**" ([C]onfiguration->[C]ommon)

**Frequently asked questions**

> Just wondering what would happen if in miners.config I set the ocprofile to a clock and then set it different within AF under the same profile number. Would one trump the other? If so which one would override? 

Only one of the two OC options can be enabled at a time:

|config.txt|MSIAprofile|EnableOCprofiles|
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Use ocprofiles.config.txt|whatever|1|
|Use Afterburner profiles|1-5|0|
|No OC switching at all|0|0|

The differences:

|   |MSIAprofiles|ocprofiles| 
|---|:---:|:---:|
|Can handle parallel miners on different GPUs|no|yes|
|Depends on Afterburner|yes|no|
|Depends on nvidiaInspector|no|yes|
|Speed with more than 6 GPU|slow|fast|
|Works for Nvidia|yes|yes|
|Works for AMD|yes|no|
|max. number of profiles|5|unlimited|
|Individual profile names|no|yes|

> I set the ocprofile to a clock and then set it different within AF under the same profile number

- MSI Afterburner profiles are fixed to a maximum of five and is being selected by their number 1 to 5 in parameter "MSIprofile" in miners.config.txt"
- ocprofiles are unlimited in ammount, you decide what their names are. RainbowMiner comes with an example ocprofiles.config.txt, where the profiles are named "Profile1", "Profile", .. "Profile9". The profile is being selected by the full name in parameter "OCprofile" in miners.config.txt (for example "Profile2")


## OC OPTION1: MSI AFTERBURNER PROFILES

Overclocking option, recommended for **unique GPU mining rigs with maximum 6 GPU**

### Introduction

MSI Afterburner allows to configure up to five profiles. Each of which defines the exact overclocking parameters for any number of GPU. RainbowMiner will never change these values, but it can be defined for miners/algorithms/devices, that another profile than the default should be used during minining (miners.config.txt, fields "MSIAprofile"). RainbowMiner comes with some miner/algorithm presets, already.

### Enable Profile Switching

By default, the profile switching is disabled. To enable MSI Afterburner profile switching:
- check or set the path to MSIA (config.txt, field "MSIApath")
- set the profile number, you want to be used as default (config.txt, field "MSIAprofile") 

### Explanation of operation

RainbowMiner's default setup has already preset some Profile fields for the following algorithms (miners.config.txt, fields "MSIAprofile"):
- ClaymoreEthash-Keccak, NeoScrypt => Profile 3
- Lyra2Re2, Lyra2z, X16r, X16s => Profile 4
- ClaymoreEthash-Blake2s, ClaymoreEthash-Pascal => Profile 5

Remember: __no overclocking values will be changed by RainbowMiner!__ It will switch your preset profiles, only.

I recommend you set the following profile setup in MSI Afterburner, so that you can use the default setup of RainbowMiner. The overclocking values in brackets (core clock/memory clock) are those I use for my GTX 1070 and are only for illustration.

- Profile 1: no oc (e.g. +0/+0)
- Profile 2: max. core / max. memory oc (e.g. +100/+400), good for most miners
- Profile 3: max. core / half memory oc (e.g. +100/+200), recm. for claymore ethash-keccak, neoscrypt
- Profile 4: max. core / low memory oc (e.g. +100/-500), recm. for lyra2re2, lyra2z, x16r, x16s
- Profile 5: max. core / reduced memory oc (e.g. +100/+350), recm. for claymore ethash-blake2s, claymore ethash-pascal

Be careful when playing with OC, since this can damage your devices. RainbowMiner will not be responsible, if you kill your devices.


## OC OPTION2: CUSTOM OVERCLOCKING PROFILES

Recommended for mining rigs with **more than 6 GPU** or **different GPU**

### Introduction

Each miner/device/algorithm combination can have it's own overclocking values set by RainbowMiner. To enable: set "**EnableOCProfiles**" to "**1**" in your config.txt or use the [C]onfiguration->[C]ommon.

**!! It is important, that you coose a default profile for each GPU device in your devices.config.txt !!**

You can edit the file directly: put the name of your custom default profile into field "**DefaultOCprofile**"
Alternatively, the devices can be changed using [C]onfiguration->[D]evices

### 1. setup overclocking profiles

Use [C]onfiguration->[O]C-Profiles to edit, create and delete overclocking profiles. Values for PowerLimit (%), ThermalLimit (°C), MemoryClockBoost (MHz), CoreClockBoost (MHz) and LockVoltagePoint (µV) (see hint below) can be defined. You may name the profiles like you want. Hint: Use the complete profile's names, when editing the config files directly. Of course you may also edit the ocprofiles.config.txt file directly.

Hint: LockVoltagePoint can only be set, if EnableOCvoltage is set to 1 in your config.txt (or use [C]onfiguration->[C]ommon to change)

### 2. set one default profile for each GPU group ###

With the help of [C]onfiguration->[D]evices it is very easy to choose a default profile for each GPU group used. The values can be edited directly in file devices.config.txt, too. Put the names of the default profiles into the property "DefaultOCprofile".

### 3. assign profiles to miner-device-algorithms

The assignment is done, using either [C]onfiguration->[M]iners or directly edited into the miners.config.txt file. Find your miner, the device it will use, plus the algorithm and put the profile's name into the field "**OCprofile**" 


## ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

RainbowMiner has a configuration function built-in: to change any parameter of the script, press key "**C**", while the script is running.
**There is no more need to edit the following config files directly.**

Config files are found in directory "Config\"
- config.txt = general settings, wallet, etc.
- pools.config.txt = pool setup, set a different wallet, workername for each pool and coin
- miners.config.txt = individually add arguments to miner (selected by name and device names and algorithm)
- devices.config.txt = control algorithms and miners to be used by specific devices
- algorithms.config.txt = globally adjust algorithms, like min. hashrate, timetofind etc.
- coins.config.txt = globally adjust specific coins, like min. hashrate, timetofind etc.
- ocprofiles.confit.txt = setup custom overclocking profiles
- autoexec.config.txt = add executables/commands to be executed when RainbowMiner starts

**Note: if you have not started the Start.bat yet, there will be no config files! Start it first!**
**Config files are in JSON format. Look here for to get an idea, how they work: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/json/index.htm**
**Be careful, when editing these files. Every comma counts!**


### Config\config.txt

The config file will contain variables to reflect default values. You can safely replace those variables with values.

An example:

    "API_ID": "$API_ID",
    "API_Key": "$API_Key",

You may replace $API_ID and $API_Key with your MiningPoolHub USER ID/API KEY

    "API_ID": "12345",
    "API_Key": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef",

#### Basic setup ####

- **Wallet** = your general BTC wallet address
- **WorkerName** = your desired worker name
- **UserName** = your MiningPoolHub user name
- **Currency** = currencies, you want to be shown [default=BTC,USD,EUR]
- **Region** = your region, [default=US]
- **API_ID** = your MiningPoolHub USER ID (found at MPH on page "Edit account")
- **API_Key** = your MiningPoolHub API KEY (found at MPH on page "Edit account")
- **UIstyle** = set to "full" for complete listing, set to "lite" for reduced listing [default=full]
- **LocalAPIport** = enter a free web-interface port localhost:<port> [default=4000]
- **EnableAutoUpdate** = set to 1 if you want RainbowMiner to be updated automatically
- **EnableAutoAlgorithmAdd** = set to 1 if Rainbowminer should add all newly added algorithms to your config.txt, during (automatic) update
- **EnableMinerStatus** = set to 1 to enable central monitoring
- **MinerStatusURL** = url to central monitoring server [default=https://rbminer.net]
- **MinerStatusKey** = your unique miner status key (get one at https://rbminer.net, you can reuse MPM keys)
- **MinerStatusEmail** = if your miningrig goes offline at https://rbminer.net/monitoring, a warning will be sent to this email-address. Leave empty, if you do not want notifications.
- **PushOverUserKey** = if your miningrig goes offline at https://rbminer.net/monitoring, a notification will be sent via https://pushover.net, using your pushover user key. Leave empty, if you do not want this.


#### Select devices ####

- **DeviceName** = list of device descriptors, with which you want to mine [default=gpu]
  - click ListDevices.bat to find out which devices are availabe
  - out of this table, models, vendors and names can be used to select
  - for mining on all GPUs, use "gpu"
  - for mining on all Nvidia GPUs use "nvidia"
  - for mining on all AMD GPUs use "amd"
  - for mining on CPU, use "cpu"
  - examples:
    - "nvidia"
    - "gtx1070,gtx1080,cpu"
    - "cpu,gpu"
    - "gpu#01,gpu#03"
- **CPUMiningThreads** = enter the number of softwarethreads being used by CPU miners. Adds "-t [threads]" to commandline of cpuminer forks
- **CPUMiningAffinity** = enter a hex number to define CPU mining core affinity (e.g. 0xAAAA). Adds "--cpu-affinity [affinity]" to commandline of cpuminer forks
- **GPUMiningAffinity** = enter a hex number to define GPU miner's CPU core affinity for validating results (e.g. 0xAAAA). Especially useful, when mining CPU and GPU in parallel.

If you defined CPUMiningThreads or CPUMiningAffinity, you may override the values for single miner, by adding your own "-t" and "--cpu-affinity" to the field Params in miners.config.txt. 
ClaymoreCPU, FireIce and JceminerCpu are not affected by these settings. They can be finetuned by editing config files (see section MINERS)

The affinity values define bitmasks, bit 0 = Core 0, bit 1 = Core 1, etc. The bitmasks are build from right to left.

Some examples:

    0 or 1 - 1 CPU/Core on or off.
    10 - Core/CPU 2 On, 1 Off.
    100 - Core/CPU 3 On, 1 and 2 off.
    101010 - Odd cores on, even off, 6 core.
    10101010 - Odd cores on, even off, 8 core.
    10101010101 - Even cores on, Odds off, 12 core.
    
To convert those binary 0/1 values into a hex number, you may use this [Bin/Hex Converter](https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/binary-to-hex.html).

**Notes for HashrateWeight**

The comparison prices of the pools will be scaled with the following formula:

    compare price = price x (1-(HashrateWeight/100)x(1-(rel. hashrate)^(HashrateWeightStrength/100))


### Config\pools.config.txt

Each pool has it's own section, in the pools.config.txt

#### Change payout currency of a pool / add more wallets (e.g. Ravenminer uses RVN)

The default pool config look like this:

    "Zpool": {
        "BTC": "$Wallet",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0
    }

The line "BTC": "$Wallet" defines the payout wallet address. $Wallet uses the value in your config.txt, $<CURRENCY> uses the value, defined for the corresponding currency in coins.config.txt
If you want to change it to LTC, for example, you have to change this line like this:

    "Zpool": {
        "LTC": "<YOUR_LITECOIN_ADDRESS>",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0
    }

Or like this, if you setup a global wallet address in coins.config.txt

    "Zpool": {
        "LTC": "$LTC",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0
    }

For non-autoexchange pools, you may define multiple wallets. The wallets define, which coins may be mined at a pool. In the following example, Rainbowminer will mine RVN and SUQA on Icemining, hereby using the default RVN wallet in the coins.config.txt.

    "Icemining": {
        "RVN": "$RVN",
        "SUQA": "<YOUR_SUQA_ADDRESS>"
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0
    }
    
Alternatively you may instruct RainbowMiner to automatically use every currency defined in coins.config.txt (which is enabled by adding a wallet address and setting parameter "EnableAutoPool" to "1") for a certain pool. To do so, set paremeter "EnableAutoCoin" to "1".
Example:

    "Icemining": {
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0,
        "EnableAutoCoin": "1"
    }

#### Add additional password parameters for YiiMP based pools

Many of our pools are based on the open-source YiiMP pool (e.g. AHashpool,BlazePool,Blockmaster,ZergPool,ZPool etc.). Some of these pools accept additional parameters. A prominent example is the setting of a custom payout limit at ZergPool (pl=x.xx). To add a password parameter, add one line to pools.config.txt in the form `"CURRENCY-Params": "parameters",`. In fact, all parameters will be added to the preset password contents, using a comma.

Example:

    "ZergPool": {
        "LTC": "<YOUR_LTC_ADDRESS>",
        "LTC-Params": "pl=1.5",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0
    }

In this example, if mining Zergpool, it will autoexchange everything into LTC. The parameter string "pl=1.5" will be added to the password, that is passed to the pool. In the case of ZergPool it will define a payout limit of 1.5 LTC. Of course any parameters can be added here, depending on the pool's options.

#### Change a pool's penalty
    
If you feel like a pool tends to exagerate it's results, you can set a penalty in % through the field "Penalty":

    "Ravenminer": {
        "RVN": "<YOUR_RAVENCOIN_ADDRESS>",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 5
    }

This would reduce the hashrate-results from the pool Ravenminer by 5%


#### Change a pool's time frame (data window)

To override the default data window "average2e" of the YiiMP based pools (AHashPool,BlazePool,BlockMasters,Hashrefinery,ZergPool,Zpool) the parameter "DataWindow" can be added to the pool's configuration record. 
Possible values are:
- estimate_current (=default): the pool's current calculated profitability-estimation (more switching, relies on the honesty of the pool)
- estimate_last24h: the pool's calculated profitability-estimation for the past 24 hours (less switching, relies on the honesty of the pool)
- actual_last24h: the actual profitability over the past 24 hours (less switching)
- minimum2: the minimum value of estimate_current and actual_last24h will be used
- maximum2: the maximum value of estimate_current and actual_last24h will be used
- average2: the calculated average of estimate_current and actual_last24h will be used
- mininum2e: the minimum value of estimate_current and estimate_last24h will be used
- maximum2e: the maximum value of estimate_current and estimate_last24h will be used
- average2e: the calculated average of estimate_current and estimate_last24h will be used
- minimum2h: the minimum value of estimate_last24h and actual_last24h will be used
- maximum2h: the maximum value of estimate_last24h and actual_last24h will be used
- average2h: the calculated average of estimate_last24h and actual_last24h will be used
- mininum3: the minimum value of the above three values will be used
- maximum3: the maximum value of the above three values will be used
- average3: the calculated average of the above three values will be used
    
Example:

    "Zpool": {
        "LTC": "<YOUR_LITECOIN_ADDRESS>",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0,
        "DataWindow": "minimum3"
    }


#### Change a pool's moving average (stat average)

The price pulled from the pool's API is being averaged down with a defined moving average trend line. The averaging time can be defined, using the parameter "StatAverage". It overrides the global default set by the config.txt parameter "PoolStatAverage".

Possible values are:
- Live: the live price
- Minute_5: five minutes moving average
- Minute_10: ten minutes moving average
- Hour: one hour moving average
- Day: one day moving average
- ThreeDay: three day moving average
- Week: one week moving average

Example:

    "Zpool": {
        "LTC": "<YOUR_LITECOIN_ADDRESS>",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "Penalty": 0,
        "DataWindow": "minimum3",
        "StatAverage": "Hour"
    }


#### Define the algorithms and coins of a pool
    
Per default all algorithms of a pool will be used. To define your own set of algorithm, there are two additional fields:
- Algorithm: a comma separated list of all pool's algorithm, you want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for all)
- ExcludeAlgorithm: a comma separated list of all pool's algorithm, you explicitly do not want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for no exception)
- CoinName: a comma separated list of coin names, you want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for all). The coin's name must be spelled exactly like it is used at the corresponding pool. It applies to the pools, that transmit the coin names, only.
- ExcludeCoin: a comma separated list of coin names, you explicitly do not want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for all coins). The coin's name must be spelled exactly like it is used at the corresponding pool. It applies to the pools, that transmit the coin names, only.
- CoinSymbol: a comma separated list of coin symbols, you want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for all). Better alternative to "CoinName"
- ExcludeCoinSymbol: a comma separated list of coin's, you want RainbowMiner to use (leave empty for all). Better alternative to "ExcludeCoin"
- EnablePostBlockMining: set to "1" to allow forced mining a specific currency for a timespan (defined in coins.config.txt), after a block has been found.
- CoinSymbolPBM: if EnablePostBlockMining is set to "1", specify which currency is taken into account for post block mining. Leave empty for all.

Example:

    "MiningPoolHub": {
        "User": "$UserName",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "API_ID": "$API_ID",
        "API_Key": "$API_Key",
        "Algorithm": "lyra2z,skein,myriadgroestl,groestl,neoscrypt,equihash-btg",
        "ExcludeAlgorithm": "",
        "CoinName": "",
        "ExcludeCoin": "",
        "CoinSymbol": "",
        "ExcludeCoinSymbol": "BTG,XTC",
        "FocusWallet": "",
        "EnablePostBlockMining": "0",
        "CoinSymbolPBM": ""
    }
    
#### Force mining to a pool's wallet

To force mining to pool's wallets, you may add the wallet's currencies to field "FocusWallet". RainbowMiner will mine into the the focused pool/wallets, only.

Example:

    "Ethermine": {
        "ETH": "0x012031012301230123012301230",
        "ZEC": "$ZEC",
        "User": "$UserName",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "API_ID": "$API_ID",
        "API_Key": "$API_Key",
        "Algorithm": "",
        "ExcludeAlgorithm": "",
        "CoinName": "",
        "ExcludeCoin": "",
        "CoinSymbol": "",
        "ExcludeCoinSymbol": "",
        "FocusWallet": "ETH,ZEC"
    }

This example will focus mining operations to pool Ethermine, comparing this pool's profitability of ETH and ZEC, only. No other pool will be mined.

#### Allow mining algorithm when pool hashrate equals to 0
    
All pool modules contain a check for an algorithm hashrate to be greater than 0. If you want to mine a special currency, even if you are the only miner (e.g. solo mining on BsodSolo), set field "AllowZero" to "1":

Example:

    "BsodSolo": {
        "SUQA": "<YOUR_SUQA_ADDRESS>",
        "Worker": "$WorkerName",
        "FocusWallet": "SUQA",
        "AllowZero": "1"
    }

### Config\miners.config.txt

Each miner can be configured by it's own section, in the miners.config.txt

Example:

- "CcminerAlexis78-GTX1070": miner CcminerAlexis78 in non-LegacyMining mode on selected GPU devices with model name GTX1070, Algorithms c11 and keccak
- "CcminerAlexis78-GTX1070": miner will use custom overclocking profile "Profile1"
- "Sgminer-AMD": miner Sgminer in LegacyMining mode, mine on all selected amd GPU, Algorithms c11 and keccak
- "MainAlgorithm": alogrithm, for which the extra configuration will be used
- "SecondaryAlgorithm": secondary alogrithm, for which the extra configuration will be used (used for dual-mining Claymore, Excavator)
- "Params": these are the extra parameters, that will be added to the miner call
- "MSIAprofile": desired MSI Afterburner profile

.. this adds a Penalty of 12.5% to all algorithms used by Trex

.. this adds a static pool difficulty of 1000 to Sgminer's Neoscrypt


### Config\devices.config.txt

Each device group can be bound to/excluded from specific algorithm and miners by editing this config file.

Example:

    {
      "GTX1050Ti": [
        {
          "Algorithm": "Ethash,x16r",
          "ExcludeAlgorithm": "",
          "MinerName": "",
          "ExcludeMinerName": "ClaymoreEthash",
          "DisableDualMining": "1",
          "DefaultOCprofile": "Profile1",
          "PowerAdjust": "100",
          "Worker": "my1050"
        }
      ],
      "R290X": [
        {
          "Algorithm": "",
          "ExcludeAlgorithm": "",
          "MinerName": "",
          "ExcludeMinerName": "",
          "DisableDualMining": "1",
          "DefaultOCprofile": "Profile1",
          "PowerAdjust": "87.5",
          "Worker": ""
        }
      ]      
    }

This configuration would:
- bind all GTX1050Ti in the system to Ethash and X16R mining, only, excluding the ClaymoreEthash miner
- setting the flag "DisableDualMining" to "1", all dual-algorithm miners will be removed from this device's list.
- for custom overclocking Profile1 is used as default for this GPU type
- set a power adjust factor of 87.5% to the Radeon R290X (if RainbowMiner reported 250W with factor 100%, it will now show 250W x 87.5 / 100 = 175W)
- the pool worker name for the GTX1050Ti will be set to "my1050". If used in combos, the individual worker names will be combined with _ (underscore)


### Config\gpugroups.config.txt

Under some circumstances you might want to divide GPUs with unique model name into multiple groups (e.g. mining on different pools). For this case, all GPUs may be grouped, using group names, to be setup in gpugroups.config.txt.
To find out the GPU numbers in your system, start ListDevices.bat

Example:
Assumed four GTX1070 GPUs running in this rig.

    {
      "GPU#00": "A",
      "GPU#01": "A",
      "GPU#02": "Zerg",
      "GPU#03": ""
    }

Using this setup, RainbowMiner will use the following model names:
- GPU#00 and GPU#01 will get name "GTX1070A"
- GPU#02 will get name "GTX1070ZERG"
- GPU#03 will keep name "GTX1070"

This will result in three separate GPU groups. Be aware, that for each device group a new entry in devices.config.txt will be created. Also, all different device group combinations will be added to miners.config.txt.


### Config\algorithms.config.txt

Globally define parameters for algorithms:

Example:

    {
      "X17": {
          "Penalty": "10",
          "MinHashrate": "50GH",
          "MinWorkers": "300",
          "MaxTimeToFind": "1.5h",
          "MSIAprofile": 4,
          "OCprofile": "Profile4"
        }
    }

This configuration would:
- reduce all X17 pool prices by a "Penalty" of 10%
- set a minimum X17 pool hashrate of 50 GH/s for a pool to be selected (units allowed: k=kilo, M=Mega, G=Giga, T=Tera, P=Peta)
- set the mimimum pool workers mining X17 to 300 for a pool to be selected
- set a maximum time to find for the next block of 1.5 hours (units allowed: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours)
- set the MSI Afterburner overclocking profile to 4 (if MSIA is used)
- set the overclocking profile to "Profile4" (if the RainbowMiner oc is used)
- the overclocking profiles define the default for a specific algorithm
- the OCprofile hierarchy: miners.config.txt over algorithms.config.txt over devices.config.txt


### Config\coins.config.txt

Globally define parameters for coins:

Example:

    {
      "RVN": {
          "Penalty": "10",
          "MinHashrate": "50GH",
          "MinWorkers": "300",
          "MaxTimeToFind": "1.5h",
          "Wallet": "<YOUR_RAVENCOIN_ADDRESS>",
          "EnableAutoPool": "1",
          "PostBlockMining": "5m"
        }
    }

This configuration would:
- reduce all RVN pool coin prices by a "Penalty" of 10%
- set a minimum RVN pool hashrate of 50 GH/s for a pool to be selected (units allowed: k=kilo, M=Mega, G=Giga, T=Tera, P=Peta)
- set the mimimum pool workers mining RVN to 300 for a pool to be selected
- set a maximum time to find for the next block of 1.5 hours (units allowed: s=seconds, m=minutes, h=hours)
- define a global RVN wallet with value <YOUR_RAVENCOIN_ADDRESS>. Every occurence of "$RVN" in pools.config.txt will be automatically substituted with this wallet.
- each pool, that has it's parameter "EnableAutoCoin" set to "1" will use this RVN wallet
- if a RVN block has been found within the timespan of 5 minutes (PostBlockMining) at a pool that has "EnablePostBlockMining" set to "1", RainbowMiner will force mining RVN on this pool.


### Config\ocprofiles.config.txt

This file contains all custom overclocking profiles. These profiles can be assigned by name to miners in file Config\miners.config.txt or to algorithms in file Config\algorithms.config.txt, field "OCprofile".

Example (this is the setup for one of my GTX1070 rigs, basicly substituting the MSI Afterburner profiles I recommended above)

    {
      "Profile1": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "0",
        "CoreClockBoost": "0",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile2": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "400",
        "CoreClockBoost": "100",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile3": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "200",
        "CoreClockBoost": "100",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile4": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "-500",
        "CoreClockBoost": "100",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile5": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "350",
        "CoreClockBoost": "100",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile6": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "0",
        "CoreClockBoost": "100",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "Profile7": {
        "PowerLimit": 0,
        "ThermalLimit": 0,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "*",
        "CoreClockBoost": "*",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "1000000"
      }
    }

- PowerLimit: in percent, set to 0, if you do not want this to be changed
- ThermalLimit: in °C, set to 0, if you do not want this to be changed
- MemoryClockBoost: in MHz, set to "*", if you do not want this to be changed
- CoreClockBoost: in MHz, set to "*", if you do not want this to be changed
- LockVoltagePoint: in µV set to "*", if you do not want this to be changed or "0", if voltagePoint should be unlocked

To make it easy to handle names, profiles may be assigned to a devices. Just add the device model (see file Config\devices.config.txt for all model names) with "-" to the profile name. With this feature, it is very easy to use different overclocking rules for each device under one name.

Example for a rig, using GTX1070Ti and GTX1060 side by side:

    {
      "MinMemOC-GTX1060": {
        "PowerLimit": 75,
        "ThermalLimit": 70,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "-500",
        "CoreClockBoost": "150",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      },
      "MinMemOC-GTX1070Ti": {
        "PowerLimit": 82,
        "ThermalLimit": 80,
        "MemoryClockBoost": "-500",
        "CoreClockBoost": "50",
        "LockVoltagePoint": "*"
      }
    }

The name of this exemplary profile is "MinMemOC" - if this name would be put into algorithms.config.txt, for example for algo "X16R", different overclocking settings would be used for the different devices when mining X16R.


### Config\autoexec.config.txt

If you want RainbowMiner to start other commands before the mining begins, you may add them to file Config\autoexec.config.txt by following the following rules:
- one line, one command
- command and path must be enclosed with doublequotes (")
- arguments (if any) must follow after the closing doublequote if the command
- a hashtag (#) marks the beginning of a comment, everything behind this within the line, will be ignored

Example:

    #
    # RainbowMiner autoexec
    # =====================
    # 

    "C:\Qbundle\BlagoMiner\Blagominer_avx.exe" --argument1 whatsoever1

.. would start Blagominer_avx.exe with commands ""--argument1 whatsoever1", setting the working directory to "C:\Qbundle\BlagoMiner"

## FAQ

### How do I add RainbowMiner's Start.bat to the windows task sheduler for autostart?

Press windows key and type `shedule`, click on `Task Sheduler`

`Create a basic task`

Tab "General":
- check `Run only when user is logged in`
- check `Run with highest privileges`
- Configure for: `Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008`

Tab "Trigger":
- check `When I log in`

Tab "Actions": 
- Action=`Start a program`
- Program/Script=`cmd`
- Add Arguments=`/c "C:\Users\RainbowMiner\Desktop\current-version\Start.bat"`
- Start In=`C:\Users\RainbowMiner\Desktop\current-version\`

### How can I rent my rig to someone at MiningRigRentals.com?

#### 1. Signup and create a rig for rent
- signup at https://www.miningrigrentals.com
- create API keys with permission "Balance/Withdraw" = "Read-Only" and "Manage Rigs" = "Yes" (Hint: if you have multiple RainbowMiner rigs, create new keys for each of it!)
- create a rig for at least one algorithm that you want to rent to an interested renter at the "MyRigs" section of the website
- optional: add pools on the "Pool Configuration" tab of the rig
- set your rig's rentable status to "available"
- edit your rig's description and add your RainbowMiner workername, enclosed with square brackets, somewhere into the text, e.g. ``[rbm]``. This is important, otherwise Rainbowminer will not find your rig, later.

#### 2. Setup Rainbowminer
- add "MiningRigRentals" to the PoolName list and make sure it is not in the ExcludePoolName list (config.txt or [C]onfiguration->[S]elections)
- edit "Config\pools.config.txt", find the MiningRigRentals section and add (API_Secret, User) or edit the following data:

  
    "API_Key": "<put your MiningRigRentals API-key here>",
    "API_Secret": "<put your MiningRigRentals API-secret key here>",
    "User": "<put your MiningRigRentals username here>",
    "Worker": "<put your RainbowMiner workername here or leave $WorkerName>",
    "EnableMining": "0",

All rigs will be automatically set to status "online", at MiningRigRentals and rest idle within RainbowMiner. If someone starts a rental, RainbowMiner will detect this and run the respective miner exclusively, until the rental ends. All other rigs on MiningRigRentals will be deactivated, for that time.

If you want to include MiningRigRentals into RainbowMiner's profitability checks and switching operation, so that it behaves just like a normal pool, set "EnableMining" to "1". Only do this, if MiningRigRentals is your only pool, because the mining prices (these are the prices setup at MiningRigRentals), will not reflect the real market prices.


### How can I make sure, my hand tuned config files in the Bin folders, will not be deleted during miner updates?

- RainbowMiner has a build-in list of protected files, that will be kept during updates: 

    config.txt
    nvidia.txt
    amd.txt
    config_*.txt

- If you want to add your own userdefined files, that should be kept from update to update, edit the file `Config\minerconfigfiles.txt` and add your files (wildcards are allowed), one at each row.

- if the automatic fails: when updating, RainbowMiner creates a backup folder that contains the full contents of the original. It is named like the original miner's folder, but date/time added with a dot (e.g. CryptoNight-SrbMiner.20181202_174533). A maximum of three backups is kept.
